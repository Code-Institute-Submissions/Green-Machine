#### The Idea:

The latest craze around town is electric scooters. Everywhere you now look in any major city across the world you will see electric scooters as they are a great alternative to a bike as you can easily fold them down to carry them on public transport if needed. 
So this gave me the idea to build a mock up website for a scooter shop based in Dublin, Ireland.
I built this website using all the content we learned on the course and more using features like the Google Maps API, EmailJS & Javascript features.

#### The goal of this website is to:

Promote the shop by having a feature packed and user friendly website that will be fully responsive across all devices. To allow customers to experience a scooter by taking one of our models for a test drive before they buy.

## User Experience

<hr>

#### User Stories:

1. As a user I want to easily navigate the site across all pages.
2. As a user I want to see what different scooter models are available.
3. As a user I want to be able to check the specifications of each model so i can compare and decide on what one i would like to purchase or take for a test drive.
4. As a user i want to be able to contact the shop to answer any queries i may have.
5. As a user I want to sign-up to a newsletter so i can be kept up to date with the latest models or special offers.

#### Design:

The project utilises the [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework to ensure Mobile first fully responsive design. When considering the design elements for this project, an eco-friendly/modern color scheme is what came to mind first.

#### Font:

The project has a main font of 'Orbitron' which was imported via css from Google Fonts, with the backup font being set to a default of 'Sans-serif'. The Robotic feel gave the website a modern look but also making each character very easy to read for the user.

#### Logo:



#### Color Scheme:

To help me choose my color scheme i used [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create).

Two primary conflicting colors were chosen when creating this project:

- ![#35b729](https://placehold.it/15/35b729/000000?text=+) `#35b729` 
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff` 

Both colours are featured across the site. On the homepage they are used to create a subtle gradient effect and also a glow in the sign-up modal.

A third color was used to give definiton were it was needed. (on icons etc)

- ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
